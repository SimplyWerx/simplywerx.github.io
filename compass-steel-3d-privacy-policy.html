    <h1>Privacy Policy for Compass Steel 3D</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 27, 2025</p>

    <p>
        We at <strong>SimplyWerx</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") are committed to protecting
 the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with our mobile application, <strong>Compass Steel 3D</strong> (the "App").
    </p>
    <p>
        Our core principle is to collect the absolute
 minimum data necessary for the App to function. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information that directly identifies you.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Our Commitment to All Users' Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect
 to personal information we may collect from all our users, across all age groups. Our App is designed to be suitable for all audiences, including children. We are committed to complying with the <strong>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong> and other
 applicable data protection laws.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
<p>
We do not collect, store, or share any personal information (such as your name, email, contacts, files, or location history). All sensor and optional location data used by the app stays on your device.
</p>


    <h2>3. Data We Collect and Why</h2>
    <p>
        The
 App's functionality depends on the following data, which is processed entirely on your device and is <strong>never transmitted to us or any third party</strong>, except as described in the "Advertisements" section below:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Sensor Data:</strong> The App uses your device's internal magnetometer (compass), accelerometer, and gyroscope sensors to determine orientation, heading, pitch, and roll. This data is processed in real-time on your device and is not stored or shared.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data (Optional):</strong> To provide features such as "True North" heading, magnetic declination, sunrise/sunset times, or altitude (MSL), the App requires access to your device's location. This location data is used only for calculations on your device and is not collected, stored, or transmitted. Location access is optional; the app functions without it, but some features may be limited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Advertisements and Third-Party Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        To support the development of the App and keep it free for most users, we display contextual advertisements provided by our
 third-party partner, <strong>Google AdMob</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In compliance with our commitment to children's privacy, we have configured our integration with Google AdMob to be <strong>child-directed</strong>. This means:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Non-Personalized
 Ads:</strong> All ads served are <strong>contextual</strong>, meaning they are related to the content of the app (e.g., ads about outdoor gear) and are <strong>not</strong> based on your personal behavior, interests, or profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Restricted Data Processing:</strong>
 Google is instructed to handle the data collected from this App in a manner compliant with COPPA.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For the purposes of serving contextual ads, preventing fraud, and for aggregated reporting, the Google Mobile
 Ads SDK may collect certain anonymous technical information. This can include:
    </p>
    <ul>        <li>Device Information: Such as device type, operating system, and language.</li>
        <li>IP Address: Used for coarse geo-location (e.g., country level).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected by Google, not by SimplyWerx. We do not have access to this information. This information is handled by Google in accordance with its own policies. For more detailed information on how Google collects and uses this data, please review Google's
 policies:

        <li><a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/15416897?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Ads Policy for child-directed content</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites"
 target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. In-App Purchases (Donations)</h2>
    <p>
        The App offers an optional, <strong>one-time in-app donation</strong>
 to upgrade to a premium, ad-free experience. These transactions are processed securely through the Google Play Store. We do not receive or store any of your personal payment information, such as credit card numbers. We only receive a confirmation
 from Google that a purchase has been made, which allows us to unlock the premium features for you.    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Consent</h2>
    <p>
        By using our application, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy
 Policy, including the collection of anonymous technical data by our ad partner, Google AdMob, for the purposes of serving contextual ads.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy
 Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>
